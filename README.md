Quadcopter / Quadrotor Simulation using Simulink

The advancements in simulation technology, computing devices and information processing platforms have made it possible to design simulation models and predict their behavior.

We intend to use these advancements by developing a simulation model for a Quadrotor system. This system is not just any normal Quadrotor system. We have added in experimental [1] findings to simulate this system which proves the fact that any such system can be modelled for a new Quadrotor according to the likings of the creator. This helps us in predicting motion dynamics when the system has been successfully implemented without the need for experimentation.

The motion is predicted by taking into consideration the electronic voltages being supplied to each of the 4 rotors. When the voltages being provided to the motors are altered, the corresponding motion changes because a change in voltage indicates a change in the speed of the motor.

In first part of this project, we focus on converting basic mechanical models into simulated models using Simulink so that we get a better understanding of what we’re working on. Simultaneously, we also try to understand the motion in the Quadrotor system by analyzing it’s equations. We also have a further understanding about the degrees of freedom in a Quadrotor.

By presenting this project, we hope to gain a good insight into mechanical model making using Simulink and enhance this in the future using various other techniques.
